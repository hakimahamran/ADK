	<p id="id-para01">The idea of ​​establishing a shelter for orphans in Kuang started in the middle of 1989. The story began when a father died leaving 9 childs in his care. Following the incident, the orphans were adopted by Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Djazuli for approximately eleven months.Coincidentally, at that time, Tuan Haji Suhaimi was the imam of the Al-Islahiyah Mosque at Batu 17, Kuang. This matter also known by the Al-Islahiyah Mosque committee members and each of them feels that a better effort should be done for the welfare of the children in the future. So a consensus was born to establish a hostel for orphans in Kuang.Alhamdulillah, this wish continued to come true when a servant of God donated a 0.5 acre piece of land in Lorong Teratai, Kuang for the purpose of building the dormitory and the owner of the land was handed over to the waqf department, Selangor Islamic Religious Council (MAIS) and Masjid Al - Islahiyah Kuang has established a temporary committee to manage the orphans.The committee chaired by Tuan Haji Suhaimi has started work to obtain funding to build a basic building to house the orphans. Funding from private individuals and corporate companies has helped the Committee to build a settlement block for the unfortunate family.<br/><br/></p>

<p id="id-para01">The development of this center has attracted the public attention where in 1991 a total of 74 orphans were placed in this center. Most of them are residents around Selangor. The laying of the foundation of Asrama Damai was done on Sunday, October 18, 1992, corresponding to 22th Rabiulakhir, 1413 Hijrah by Y.B Dato' Abu Bakar bin Abdul Hamid. He was then a member of the Selangor Darul Ehsan state government meeting council.Occasionally the orphans of this hostel are increasing and this accretion is also in the area of ​​the dormitory waqf land to four acres in the name of waqaf for Damai Hostel, Kuang, this hostel was once visited by the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, together with Tuanku Permaisuri to defame the royals to visit the entire dormitory area.</p>
